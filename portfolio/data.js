    content: `<h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
                    and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
                    learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
                    was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
                    take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
                    use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                    short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
                    my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
                    motivated.
